abstract = {It is shown that in all those gauge theories in which the electromagnetic group U(1) is taken to be a subgroup of a larger group with a compact covering group, like SU(2) or SU(3), genuine magnetic monopoles can be created as regular solutions of the field equations. Their mass is calculable and of order 137 MW, where MW is a typical vector boson mass.}

It is shown that the formation of domain wall, strings or monopoles depends on the homotopy groups of the manifold of degenerate vacua. The subsequent evolution of these structures is investigated. It is argued that while theories generating domain walls can probably be eliminated (because of their unacceptable gravitational effects), a cosmic network of strings may well have been formed and may have had important cosmological effects.}

abstract = {We systematically review some standard issues and also the latest developments of modified gravity in cosmology, emphasizing on inflation, bouncing cosmology and late-time acceleration era. Particularly, we present the formalism of standard modified gravity theory representatives, like F(R), F(G) and F(T) gravity theories, but also several alternative theoretical proposals which appeared in the literature during the last decade. We emphasize on the formalism developed for these theories and we explain how these theories can be considered as viable descriptions for our Universe. Using these theories, we present how a viable inflationary era can be produced in the context of these theories, with the viability being justified if compatibility with the latest observational data is achieved. Also we demonstrate how bouncing cosmologies can actually be described by these theories. Moreover, we systematically discuss several qualitative features of the dark energy era by using the modified gravity formalism, and also we critically discuss how a unified description of inflation with dark energy era can be described by solely using the modified gravity framework. Finally, we also discuss some astrophysical solutions in the context of modified gravity, and several qualitative features of these solutions. The aim of this review is to gather the different modified gravity techniques and form a virtual modified gravity “toolbox”, which will contain all the necessary information on inflation, dark energy and bouncing cosmologies in the context of the various forms of modified gravity.}

This is in contrast to the situation with any softer equation of state \\$(p=\\alpha \\mu ,\\,0\\leqslant\\alpha \\lt \\text\\{I\\})\\$, when a black hole cannot grow very much. If the universe is stiff until some time t*, this means that any primordial black holes either formed before then or fed into the universe ab initio will just grow to the horizon size at t*. This implies a lower limit on the mass of a primordial black hole of \\$\\{10\\}^\\{15\\}\\times (\\{t\\}\_\\{*\\}/\\{10\\}^\\{-23\\}\\,\\text\\{s\\})\\, \\text\\{g\\}.\\$ If t* exceeds 10-23s, no primordial black holes could have evaporated by now through the Hawking process. Thus the strong observational limits on the number of 1015 g black holes would no longer exclude the possibility that primordial black holes have a critical density. If the stiff era is extended for as long as possible \\$(\\{t\\}\_\\{*\\}\\,\\sim \\,\\{10\\}^\\{-4\\}\\text\\{s\\})\\$, there could be a concentration of primordial black holes with mass around 1 M⊙.

abstract = {We update the constraints on the fraction of the Universe that may have gone into primordial black holes (PBHs) over the mass range 10−5 to 1050 g. Those smaller than ∼1015 g would have evaporated by now due to Hawking radiation, so their abundance at formation is constrained by the effects of evaporated particles on big bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the Galactic and extragalactic γ-ray and cosmic ray backgrounds and the possible generation of stable Planck mass relics. PBHs larger than ∼1015 g are subject to a variety of constraints associated with gravitational lensing, dynamical effects, influence on large-scale structure, accretion and gravitational waves. We discuss the constraints on both the initial collapse fraction and the current fraction of the dark matter (DM) in PBHs at each mass scale but stress that many of the constraints are associated with observational or theoretical uncertainties. We also consider indirect constraints associated with the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations, such as second-order tensor perturbations and μ-distortions arising from the effect of acoustic reheating on the CMB, if PBHs are created from the high-σ peaks of nearly Gaussian fluctuations. Finally we discuss how the constraints are modified if the PBHs have an extended mass function, this being relevant if PBHs provide some combination of the DM, the LIGO/Virgo coalescences and the seeds for cosmic structure. Even if PBHs make a small contribution to the DM, they could play an important cosmological role and provide a unique probe of the early Universe.}
